<h2>What is a Mesh</h2>
<p>A mesh network consists of Wi-Fi router "nodes" spread throughout the city. The network has no central server and no single internet service provider. All nodes cooperate in the distribution of data, serving as a stand-alone network in case of emergencies.</p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We aim to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies—be it power outages or internet disruption—running software that helps our community with hyperlocal maps and events.

    <h3>Install Node</h3>
    <p>Our network grows stronger with each new node, so if you are located in NYC and have rooftop access please let us know.</p>
    <p>It's all about installing a router for less than $100. We install and configure it for you.</p>
    <p>There are <strong>no</strong> monthly fees and you'll help us grow.</p>
