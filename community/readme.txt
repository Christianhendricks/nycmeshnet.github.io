This is the new repository location for the community portal. I will add these things:

1. Database of potential access points, available as a csv, a map should be possible later
2. Forms, fliers, and neighborhood coordinator materials
3. The network commons license, so that all users are aware of the terms
4. Links to our internal google docs (still on accessible as per their permissions)
5. Other ideas?
