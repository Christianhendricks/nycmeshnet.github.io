[Trifold Brochure](https://nycmesh.net/leaflet/meshmail.pdf)  


### Not sure if sharing is for you?  
I will convince you later using math without being too technical  

### Why you/your organization should partner with NYCMesh  
-Secure  

-Cheap  

-Energy-efficient  

-Ensures that the bandwidth you pay for is used when your organization cannot use it  

-As a 501c(3) non-profit, all donations are tax deductible  


### How am I charged?  

Our network, resources, software, and support are totally free. That will always be the case. At some point in the future we may add premium services or a pointless 'gold' membership to re-coup losses on hardware, but never to the detriment of the network. This will never mean that free traffic will be de-prioritized over paying traffic. However, certain real-time applications like voice and video may receive priority transmission without regard to the user's payment status.  

#### Wh-What?
It's free to surf the web, but you can pay us if you want to.
