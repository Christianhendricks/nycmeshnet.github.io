<h2>Map of NYC Mesh nodes</h2>
<p>This map shows our node locations. The colored markers are currently active nodes. The larger markers are rooftops. The gray markers are node requests from the "Join" form. We are currently working to turn these into active nodes. 

As of August 2015, we have around 29 active nodes and we are adding about one or two per week.</p>
