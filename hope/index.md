# We’ve become official, just in time for HOPE!

We now have fiscal sponsorship with the [New York Chapter] (https://isoc-ny.org) of the Internet Society. We can get the insurance and start paying rent and bandwidth costs at our proposed [supernode] (https://nycmesh.net/blog/supernode/). We need about 10k to start providing free access to the internet through our mesh, without going through the telecom oligopoly. That first chunk gets us a cabinet at a co-location center, a rack, and a rooftop view of most of the city. Our pricing scales quickly, but even at that price we can undercut the telecom oligopoly. After that for 1k a month, we can get a fiber connection to not only the ‘internet’, but fiber connections to services like Netflix and Google (at the co-location area), and anything else we choose to host in our cabinet on the top floor. That’s a dollar per dedicated Mb/s, not ‘up to.’ Our connection isn’t metered like cell phones, capped like Comcast, or overpriced like FiOS. Check out our [FAQ](https://nycmesh.net/faq) for a pretty thorough walkthrough.

We are North America’s largest Mesh network. We have (50 active hotspots): https://www.nycmesh.net/map, with hundreds more coming down the pipeline. If you live in the area and would like to hop on the network, our join form is [here] (https://www.nycmesh.net/join). Access is and will always remain free. You must extend and share-alike. We will never sell, collect, log, mine, or in any way exploit your data. We are funded entirely by [donations]: https:/nycmesh.net/donate. Do you have a service that needs a last mile solution and/or a safe and secure connection to the internet? Email us at  <partners@nycmesh.net>. All memberships and donations are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor. 

This weekend, we’ll be at the ISOC table in the organization section as well as hacking it up in the Hackerspace Village. We’ll be talking data centers and playing around with sub-Ghz antennas for non line-of-sight meshing. If you want to get involved, hop on our slack channel at nycmesh.slack.com. We’ve got a #hope room set up for the conference. 

On Monday, we’re having (meetup):https://meetup.com/nycmesh, 6:30pm  Bar d.b.a.
41 1st Avenue, New York, NY. We’ve already got a crew schedule to be there, including a delegation from Toronto’s [Tomesh](https://tomesh.net/)
